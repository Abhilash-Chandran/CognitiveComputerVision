# Attention
---
Attention is the cognitive process of selectively concentrating on one aspect of the environment while ignoring other things. [__wikipedia__]

__Focus of Attention(FOA)__ is the location where our attention is focused in the current scene.[_Attentional Beam_]. This involves two stages
1. Pre-Attentive Stage
  * Happens in parallel without much effort
  * Automatically without your knowledge
  * Early in the perception process
  * Result of this is FOA.
2. Attentive Stage
  * Sequentially investigate one region(FOA) at a time.

# Feature Integration Theory
---
![FIT.png is missing](img/day4/FIT.png)

Anne Treisman and gary Gelade introduced the an influential psychological model of visual attention in the early 1980's known as **Feature Integration Theory**. According to this theory, in a human brain different features are processed in parallel in different areas of the brain(_pre-attentive-stage_) and a **Master map of locations_** is formed by combining them using our attention.

**e.g:** While looking at an object different features of it like color, orientation, edges, etc., are processed separately and glued together to identify an object in a later stage.

# Koch-Ullman model
---
Koch-Ullman model fills tries to address the gap in FIT which doesn't specify how the master map of locations are achieved. It is the basis for most of the **Computaional Visual Attention** models.

It suggests that, the conspicuity[_attracting of attention_] of a location in a visual scene determines the level of activity in a specific region within the feature maps. Such feature dependent saliency maps are often called **_conspicuity maps_**

A **_saliency map_** combines the information of all such conspicuity maps into one global measure.

# Visual Attention
---
Visual Attention a.k.a visual search were often tested using artificial visual search tests in which users are asked to locate a target element amongst a group of other element. This difficulty of this task depends of 3 factors.
1. The size of set of elements.
2. The similarity between the distractor and target.
3. the similarity between the distractors themselves.

# Guided Search Model
---

Wolfe developed Guided Search Model to augment the FIT model. In this model the feature maps are influenced by both bottom-up(BU) and top-down(TU) cues.
![Guided Search Model](img/day4/GuSM.png)
eg. If you are looking a coffee mug in room, you know exactly what features you are looking for. This means, this knowledge could influence you search speed in a positive manner.

## Attention Types


| Bottom Up Cues | Top Down Cues |
| --- | --- |
| Automatic | Influenced by what you know. |
| Known as saliency | Known as endogenous or voluntary |
| Reflexive in nature | motivation based or expectations. Involves context as well. |

-Bottom up has involuntary influence  on the attention. eg: emergency bell during a lecture.
-_Pop-Out-effect_ occurs in a visual search problem where a target "leaps out of the display" to capture our attention. e.g. A red ball amongst yellow balls.

## Basic Features for Saliency
According a to the research by Wolfe and Horowitz, some features act as core basic features which are gathered by our brain pre-attentively and almost in parallel.

* Color
* Motion
* Orientation
* Size (length, width, etc.)
_Additionally_
* Luminance
* Stereoscopic depth

# Inhibition of Return(IOR)
---
Posner and Cohen discovered a mechanism in the human vision which inhibits the cells corresponding to the currently fixated region, preventing the focus from returning to that region immediately.

This is important because as per a study by Itti & koch, human brains receive information at the rate of 10^8 bits per second and so it is important to prioritize and thus decide and act quickly. this is only possibly by selectively processing certain areas in the scene. e.g. Imagine you are being chased down by a Tiger, would you slowly wait to process all that you see or just focus on finding the safest path.

| Overt Attention | Covert Attention |
| --- | --- |
| Direct the eyes to the region of Interest | Direct eyes to ROI without moving your eyes |


It is good to note that all these attention doesn't happen in a selective area in the brain but rather dispersed across different areas.
