Attention
===
Attention is the cognitive process of selectively concentrating on one aspect of the environment while ignoring other things. [__wikipedia__]

__Focus of Attention(FOA)__ is the location where our attention is focused in the current scene.[_Attentional Beam_]. This involves two stages
1. Pre-Attentive Stage
  * Happens in parallel without much effort
  * Automatically without your knowledge
  * Early in the perception process
  * Result of this is FOA.
2. Attentive Stage
  * Sequentially investigate one region(FOA) at a time.

|Attention based on what one focuses on. Other things are not perceived | Failure to notice changes happening within in a brief moment|

Attention Types
======

| Bottom Up Cues | Top Down Cues |
| --- | --- |
| Automatic | Influenced by what you know. |
| Known as saliency | Known as endogenous or voluntary |
| Reflexive in nature | motivation based or expectations. Involves context as well. |

Guided Search Model.
------
1. Involves both bottom up and top down feature maps.
2. Bottom up has involuntary influence  on the attention. eg: emergency bell during a lecture.

Basic Features for Saliency
------
* Color
* Motion
* Orientation
* Size :P

| Overt Attention | Covert Attention |
| --- | --- |
| Direct the eyes to the region of Interest | Direct eyes to ROI without moving your eyes |
